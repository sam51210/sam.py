<h1 align=center>Pushing the limits of Python</h2>
<p align=center>Sam.py is a Python project where anyone can come and add their own Python scripts.</p>

<h2 align=center>How does it work?</h2>

<p align=center>Sam.py all works based off of 1 script: <b>Sampyhub.py</b>. The diagram above explains it well, but here it is in words: when you run Sampyhub.py, you are prompted to enter the module (Python script) you'd like to run. From there, it tells you the name and author and confirms you want to run it. We always make sure modules are safe, malicious code has no place in Sam.py.</p>

<h2 align=center>How can I contribute and what are the rules?</h2>
<p align=center>To contribute, simply download Sampyhub.py, make your changes, save it and run the dev.py module. The rules are simple:
<ol align=center>
  <li>No malicious code (sam.py users are putting their trust in us - we have to utilise it in a good way)</li>
  <li>No obsfucated code (this defeats the purpose of Sam.py being open-source. It also allows room for malicious code.)</li>
  <li>Comment your code to your best ability (also leave your mark with your GitHub username)</li>
</ol>
