            Welcome to the Sam.py development community!
            
            We are so happy you're interested in helping out. It's
            not difficult to modify the code as it's well documented
            and commented. It's not too advanced - but we welcome
            any skills levels!
            
            With that said, get coding and send it over to us on Discord
            by DMing @sam51211. You will always be mentioned in the
            credits.py module, even if you edit one line of code!
