# Sam.py/scripts - What is this folder?
The scripts folder is for scripts that are or will be in Sampyhub soon. It also serves a purpose if you don't want to edit Sampyhub.py, but still want your scripts included.

## Can I add my own scripts?
Absolutely! Just open a pull request and we'll review it.
